# Q-Learning and Actror-Critic for LunarLander-v2

This repository contains the implementation of Q-Learning and Actor-Critic algorithms for the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym. The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library for neural networks.

**Q-Learning**

- Basic Q-Learning algorithm with epsilon-greedy policy
- Duel Q-Learning
- Double Q-Learning
- Double Duel Q-Learning

**Actor-Critic**

- Basic Actor-Critic algorithm
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
